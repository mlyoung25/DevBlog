Hello!

## Meeting on Sunday Sep, 23. 

First Marketing assignment before Antonio has a meeting with Twitch employee about sponsoring us
Get budgeting for trip to GDC for **x** amount of students to travel

Second is to create a coherent Brand image for WolverineSofts, with persona of who we wanna reach and why. 
I started by interviewing MQ and Kaavya to get their thoughts on who we currently reached, and who we want to reach in the future.
Then I moved on to asking other potential students about why they may not join compared to other clubs.

I then also took this hour long course on inbound marketing buyer personas on reccomendation from Antonio, who said it would help me to recognize and build a common marketing language for the future.

I last spent a few hours creating marketing personas for each type of "customer" we intend to market to. The goal was to create something with the persona tool that would easily show who this person was, their goals and challenges towards working with us, our goals to working with them, and how we can reach them. I ended up redoing them all later to have a cohesive style and formatting for the confluence.
