### Social Media Posts:
For this sprint, with the coming deadline of a U-M + EMU Games Showcase some projects have fallen to me to finish up. Making some marketing materials and some social media posts fell to me to create for this sprint. It took a little bit to coordinate with Jacob and Antonio about the posts and what to write but we got it done.

### Project Quest Postmortem:
The final thing Antonio assigned to me to work on for this sprint was an ending devblog sort of story about what the process was like while working and try to tell a narrative about our time working during each dev cycle. He wants this to be a piece we do each semester for every cycle. Currently is unknown what medium it should take, whether it should be a video type of documentary or a write up blogpost but this week my assignment is to write a narrative based on the week by weeks with unexpected developments, assumptions/beliefs, and how we moved forward. And a special section to highlight learnings moving forwards similar to the post-mortem surveys we already do. I plan to hopefully incorporate that element as well.

- Meeting times: 7 hours
