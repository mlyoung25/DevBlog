### Marketing software End
Ending the marketing software, decided to just go ahead and convert what we needed onto the Hubspot. Wrote small debrief to talk about problems and solution that we encountered and why we ended up going with hubspot to present at the next marketing meeting. All in all, a valueable project although not much to show for it.

### Alumni Newsletter
Without another job to work on at the next meeting i picked up the work on compiling data for a newsletter to publish. Antonio said he put out feelers on Linkedin and at the MDev conference for potential interest and he seemed to like the responses, saying there may be enough interest in what we're doing. The example he wanted us to look at was the articles Bungee would put out for transparency called "This week at Bungee". 

What the idea was is to make two newsletter type contents, one to put out semi-frequently about every 2 weeks for studio updates, to show everyone within and interested parties progress on both projects (as they may seem semi-disconnected now), and show off potential upcoming work with concept art similar to the spotlights in the project meetings.

The other newsletter is wanted to be monthly, sent out to mostly alumni or other industry contacts to talk about what upcoming events we might be going out to or to show off completed work and other things we're proud of. This one is meant to be more purposeful with what we show, and be our outfacing presense we want to end up posting on social channels like linkedin.

After the weekly meeting on Sunday, Howard shared with me the studio weekly meeting slides for Project Multiply and I began compiling the interesting data and things to show off into groups for the month and week, and building example letters for last month to send out with the data from October. Looking forward this could be a great way to get more engagement with alumni, but the monthly newsletter is something I worry about as I think i would need more photos or data from events that I'm not 100% knowledgable about. Things like Youmacon or MDev and how they went for us. I will have to schedule some more meetings or ask on discord, but this is looking promising.
